# Git Definitions
###Instructions: Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
	Version control is a system of managing folders and files where each and every draft is stored, documented, and available for recovery. It's useful for micro-managing projects.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
	A branch is an exact copy of a master repository that can be edited and later merged to the master(main) project.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
	A commit is a basically a saved change. It tells the repo to log this change. A good commit message tells the reader exactly what you changed and why.
* What is a merge conflict?
	A point in which git cannot commit your changes because the contradict other changes made.
